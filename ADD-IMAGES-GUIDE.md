## 🔧 If Images Don't Appear

**Check:**
- ✅ File names are exactly: `viking-mascot.png` and `course-map.png`
- ✅ Files are in the correct folder: `/Users/ajfrank/Desktop/VES 5K/images/`
- ✅ File extensions are `.png` (or update HTML if using `.jpg`)
- ✅ Try hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows)

## 📝 Alternative: If You Have Different File Names

If your images have different names, you can either:

**Option 1: Rename your files** to match what's in the code:
- `viking-mascot.png`
- `course-map.png`

**Option 2: Update the HTML** (let me know and I can help with this)

**Once you add the images, your website will have the complete Viking branding and course map!** 🎉
